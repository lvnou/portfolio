# portfolio
This code was written to keep track of and evaluate my private investments. 
The github repo is mainly for me to keep track of developement, but it is public in case someone else also finds this useful.
Please note though that the code is under (more or less) active developement. Thus, more features may be added in the future but also interfaces could break.

## Description
A small Python code for tracking private investments.
It allows to evaluate the diversification of one's portfolio by e.g. geographic region or risk level.
More features may be added in the future.

## Installation
Preferably use an `anaconda` or `miniconda` environment.
With
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
install the required dependencies.
Then, install the portfolio repository with
```
pip install -e .
```
in the cloned git repository.

## Usage
See the Jupyter notebooks in the `examples/` directory.
Also, the test cases in `test/` show how the code is applied.
